    <h1>My name is <span id="more-1" class="more">Merrin Macleod</span>. I'm a <span id="more-3" class="more">good person</span> and I'm looking for <span id="more-2" class="more">work</span>.</h1>
    <p id="reveal-1" class="hidden">I'm a designer and developer <span id="more-10" class="more">living in</span> Wellington, New Zealand. This October, I'm looking for a job, because I just left mine. <span id="reveal-10" class="hidden">I'd prefer to stick around Wellington, but relocating isn't out of the question.</span></p>
    <div id="reveal-2" class="hidden">
      <p>My skills and <span id="more-99" class="more">experience</span> are in <span id="more-4" class="more">design</span>, <span id="more-5" class="more">development</span>, and <span id="more-6" class="more">writing</span>.</p>

        I want to create technology that makes the world a little better for <span id="more-7" class="more">humans</span>.

      <p class="hidden" id="reveal-7">
        In particular I'm interested in improving public knowledge, diversity in powerful groups, and somehow addressing the very bleak existential threat of climate change.

        I want to improve the tech <span id="more-8" class="more">community</span>.
      </strong></p>
      <p class="hidden" id="reveal-8">
        I believe that an inclusive tech community is vital to improving the technology we create. <br />
        I'm heavily involved with the Ruby community. I organise Rails Girls in Wellington, coached in Auckland, and I sit on the inaugural Ruby New Zealand committee. <br />
        I'm a member of InternetNZ, and I hosted a session at NetHui this year. <br />
        I coached at the Summer of Tech Hackathon a few months ago. Last year I spoke on integrating design and development in the Summer of Tech seminar series.

        I like <span id="more-9" class="more">open source</span>.

      <p class="hidden" id="reveal-9">
        Most recently I <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/askaway/askaway/graphs/contributors">contributed</a> to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.askaway.org.nz">AskAway</a> for the initial build in last year's Wellington mayoral elections and the rebuild for the general election this year. Through this I've become involved with Code for New Zealand.

      <p>Types of design I have <span class="more" id="more-15">experience</span> with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="more" id="more-11">User experience</span> design</li>
        <li><span class="more" id="more-12">Brand identity</span> creation</li>

      </ul>
      <div class="hidden" id="reveal-11">
        <p>
          User experience design is the field where I have the most <span class="more" id="more-21">opinions</span> and <span class="more" id="more-16">experience</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="hidden" id="reveal-21">
          If everything that impacts on user experience is a design decision, that means that user experience design has to be <span class="more" id="more-20">involved</span> with <span class="more" id="more-17">development</span><span id="reveal-17" class="hidden"> (page speed, accessibility and device compatibility have huge impacts on user experience)</span>, <span class="more" id="more-18">business analysis</span><span id="reveal-18" class="hidden"> (understanding your market is deeply aligned with understanding the user)</span>, and anything that affects the context in which a service is <span class="more" id="more-19">used</span><span id="reveal-19" class="hidden"> (such as marketing)</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="hidden" id="reveal-20">I see user experience design as a collaborative endeavour, building shared understanding amongst everyone who makes decisions that impact on the user experience. It involves user research and testing, and it involves bringing together different parts of the team who build a product. The visible part is using the understanding from users and the team to create user personas, journeys and wireframes. The bulk of the work involved with getting those artifacts right is talking to people, understanding and negotiating user and business needs, and communicating that to everyone who has impacts on the user experience. </p>
        <p class="hidden" id="reveal-16">I've spent the last two years at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rabid.co.nz">Rabid</a> creating and practising a user experience design process that works for building web and mobile apps for clients. I've run workshops, made prototypes from paper to code, and run usability testing sessions with end users. I've improved the understanding of end users from business analysis to development, and have guided development to build products that are good for people.</p>

        <p>The most prominent branding I've created is for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rabid.co.nz">Rabid</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CampaignForMarriageEquality">Campaign for Marriage Equality</a>, including style guides and supporting imagery.</p>

        <p>I enjoy illustration. I drew all of the pictures on this website with a trackpad and Photoshop. I've designed T-shirts for two consecutive NZ Rails Camps.</p>

        <p>I use a Canon 60D and I've had my photography and videography used for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rabid.co.nz">Rabid</a>, PledgeMe, the Campaign for Marriage Equality, and I've photographed events. It's a field I'd likeÂ to expand my skills in. I have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/macleod_merrin/">Flickr</a>.</p>

      <div class="left-illustration">
        <img src="images/typing-animated.gif">
      </div>
      <p>I have experience with the following technologies and methodologies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML and <span class="more" id="more-22">CSS</span> (and HAML and Handlebars and SASS)</li>
        <li>Javascript and <span class="more" id="more-23">JQuery</span></li>
        <li><span class="more" id="more-24">Ruby</span> and Ruby based web frameworks - Rails, Sinatra, Jekyll</li>
        <li><span class="more" id="more-25">Agile</span> development</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hidden" id="reveal-22">
        I write nice, maintainable front-end code bases with object-oriented CSS and semantic HTML5 markup, often using SASS as a pre-processor. I've also used Bootstrap extensively.HTML and CSS can be a powerful design tool, and for web apps I advocate a workflow of creating modular style guides rather than building page-by-page high-fidelity designs. Good CSS architecture can be reflected in a consistent experience that is easier to use and less painful to maintain. 
      </p>
      <p class="hidden" id="reveal-23">
        I am somewhat of an intrepid beginner at Javascript. I'm comfortable with JQuery. I go to wellington.js a lot and look at other people using Javascript. 
      </p>
      <p class="hidden" id="reveal-24">
        My focus is on the front end of the web, but I'm perfectly capable of contributing to Rails apps and building my own Sinatra or Jekyll apps.

      <p class="hidden" id="reveal-25">
        During my time at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rabid.co.nz">Rabid</a> we improved the way we use agile methodologies to be more in line with Scrum, while keeping in mind the flexibility involved with the <a target="_blank" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile manifesto</a>. To integrate design with development we used tools from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jeffgothelf.com/blog/lean-ux-book/">Lean UX</a>.

          I've spent part of my time at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rabid.co.nz">Rabid</a> involved with the business writing process, particularly writing proposals. I often take several rewrites to ensure that writing is clear, using specialised terms where necessary but avoiding excessive jargon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also contributed to writing several internal documents for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rabid.co.nz">Rabid</a>, such as policies, communication guidelines, and brand values.
