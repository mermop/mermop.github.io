    <h1>I'm Merrin Macleod and I'm looking for work.</h1>
    <p>Broadly my skills are in design (particularly UX), front-end development in the sense that is relatively light on the Javascript, and I've been enjoying a bit of business writing and analysis. I'm looking for something that combines a few of those in an interesting way.</p>

    <p>I'm also the organiser of Rails Girls here in Wellington, and I do a bit of Ruby. I do a little bit of open source, including contributing to AskAway for the initial build in last year's Wellington mayoral elections and the rebuild for the general election this year. My github profile is <a href="http://www.github.com/mermop">mermop</a> if you want to check that out. </p>
