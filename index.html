    <h1>I'm Merrin Macleod and I'm looking for work.</h1>
    <p>I'm a designer and developer living in Wellington, New Zealand. This October, I'm looking for a job. I'd prefer to stick around Wellington, but relocating isn't out of the question.</p>
    <p>My skills are in design (particularly UX), development (particularly front-end), and writing (particularly editing).</p>
    <p><strong>I want to create technology that makes the world a little better for humans.</strong> In particular I'm interested in improving public knowledge, diversity in powerful groups, and somehow addressing the very bleak existential threat of climate change.</p>
    <p><strong>I strongly believe that improving the inclusivity of the tech community is vital to improving the quality and impact of the technology we create.</strong> I'm the organiser of Rails Girls here in Wellington, coached at Rails Girls in Auckland, and I'm fairly heavily involved with the Ruby community, currently sitting on the inaugural Ruby New Zealand committee. I'm a member of InternetNZ, and I hosted a session at NetHui this year. I coached at the Summer of Tech Hackathon a few months ago, and last year I spoke on integrating design and development workflows as part of the Summer of Tech seminar series. The talk involved a metaphor about ducks.</p>
    <p><strong>I do a little bit of open source.</strong> Most recently I contributed to <a href="http://www.askaway.org.nz">AskAway</a> for the initial build in last year's Wellington mayoral elections and the rebuild for the general election this year. Through this I've become involved with Code for New Zealand. My github profile is <a href="http://www.github.com/mermop">mermop</a>.</p>

      <p>Design is an extremely broad term. Once I went to a meetup about good design, thinking it would be relevant to me, but it was about systems design. My impression from that was that it is best to keep things as separate as possible so they don't become reliant on each other. That is the extent of my understanding of systems design. Types of design I have experience with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User experience design</li>
        <li>Brand identity creation</li>
        <li>Illustration</li>
        <li>Photography</li>
      </ul>
      <p>User experience design is the field where I have the most opinions and experience. If everything that impacts on user experience is a design decision, that means that user experience design has to be involved with development (for example, page speed, accessibility and device compatibility all have huge impacts on user experience), business analysis (understanding your market is deeply aligned with understanding the user of a particular service, and usable workflows may not always be compatible with what the business initially envisions), and anything that affects the context in which a service is used (such as marketing).</p>
      <p>I see user experience design as a collaborative endeavour, building shared understanding amongst everyone who makes decisions that impact on the user experience. It involves user research and testing, and it involves bringing together different parts of the team who build a product. The visible part is using the understanding from users and the team to create user personas, journeys and wireframes. The bulk of the work involved with getting those artifacts right is talking to people, facilitating workshops, and understanding and negotiating user and business needs. </p>
      <p>I've spent the last two years at Rabid creating and practising a user experience design process that works for building web and mobile apps for clients. I've run workshops, made prototypes from paper to code, and run usability testing sessions with end users. I've improved the understanding of end users from business analysis to development, and have guided development to build products that are good for people.</p>
      <p>The most prominent branding I've created is for Rabid and the Campaign for Marriage Equality, including style guides and supporting imagery.</p>
      <p>Illustration isn't necessarily a super strength, but I do enjoy it. I drew all of the pictures on this website with a trackpad and Photoshop. I've designed T-shirts for two consecutive NZ Rails Camps.</p>
      <p>I use a Canon 60D and I've had my photography and videography used for Rabid, PledgeMe, the Campaign for Marriage Equality, and I've photographed events. It's a field I'd likeÂ to expand my skills in. I have a Flickr.</p>
      <p>It's also probably worth mentioning I am a paper short of a Design Innovation degree in Culture and Context from Victoria University of Wellington. The paper I'm short is only offered in second semester and I was too busy to enrol in it this year. It'd be good to finish that up next year.</p>

      <p>I have experience with the following technologies and methodologies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML and CSS (and HAML and Handlebars and SASS)</li>
        <li>Javascript and JQuery</li>
        <li>Ruby and Ruby based web frameworks - Rails, Sinatra, Jekyll</li>
        <li>Agile development</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I write nice, maintainable front-end code bases with object-oriented CSS and semantic HTML5 markup. I strongly believe that HTML and CSS can be a powerful design tool, and for web apps I advocate a workflow of creating modular style guides rather than building page-by-page high-fidelity designs. Good CSS architecture can be reflected in a consistent experience that is easier to use and less painful to maintain. Pre-processors like SASS help fill in some of the gaps of CSS as a language. </p>
      <p>This site is written using Javascript and JQuery. It probably represents about a fifth of the Javascript I've ever written. Read the source code if you dare.</p>
      <p>I'm mostly better at the front end of the web, but I'm perfectly capable of contributing to Rails apps and building my own Sinatra or Jekyll apps.</p>
      <p>During my time at Rabid we improved the way we use agile methodologies to be more in line with Scrum, while keeping in mind the flexibility involved with the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile manifesto</a>. To integrate design with development we used tools from Lean UX. </p>

      <p>I enjoy English. I know a little Japanese, but don't test me on it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Business writing</li>
        <li>Writing for the web</li>
        <li>Social media</li>
        <li>Haiku</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I've spent part of my time at Rabid involved with the business writing process, particularly writing proposals. I often take several rewrites to ensure that writing is clear, using specialised terms where necessary but avoiding excessive jargon.</p>
      <p>I also contributed to writing several internal documents for Rabid, such as policies, communication guidelines, and brand values.</p>
      <p>I contributed heavily to the copy currently on the <a href="http://www.rabid.co.nz">Rabid</a> website.</p>
      <p>I co-managed social media accounts for the Campaign for Marriage Equality in the lead-up to the 2012 vote on the issue.</p>
